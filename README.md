## Breakdown
All the work in this project is done by Yan Jin.

## Project
The human brain is a complex system whose topological organization can be represented using connectomics. However, the existing brain connectivity network visualization toolboxes are difficult to use, and some toolboxes could not provide interactive operations. In this paper, we implement an interactive brain connectivity network based on D3.js, which could provide more animations and interactive operations so that it is much helpful to the brain connectivity research.

## Running Instructions
Two ways to access interactive brain connectivity network:

1. access this link [http://cse512-16s.github.io/fp-jyfeather/](http://cse512-16s.github.io/fp-jyfeather/) with demo results.
2. download the master branch, run the file `main.R` in R with modifying the parameters, then move the result into the file `functional.json`; then run `jekyll serve`, and open the prompted web address, typically `127.0.0.1:4000`.
